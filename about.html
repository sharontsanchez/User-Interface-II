    <h1> Hello! </h1>
    <section class="about">
        <p>Growing up in an era of floppy-disk and dial-up internet, I never imagined to find myself in the world of
            programming.
        <p>Nevertheless I found joy as I explained to my 60-year old mother about the intricacies that went into making
            a website, adding responsive design to make it accessible.</p>
        <p> I am currently studying Full Stack Web Development at Lambda School, a 6-month intensive programming school
            focusing on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, React, Python, Redux, and SQL.</p>
        <p>As the world expands into the realm of technology; this opportunity at Lambda will help me grow and succeed.</p>    
        <p>My areas of interest are sustainability, travel, health and wellness, nutrition and education.</p>
        <p>I am looking forward to when I can apply my skills and passions to provide positive impact to local and
            international communities alike.</p>
